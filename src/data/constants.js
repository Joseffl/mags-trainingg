    title: "Installation of Stationary Pumps for Fire Protection",
    date: "Oct 2022 - Present",
    description:
    [
      "The installation of stationary pumps for fire protection is a critical aspect of ensuring that a facility or structure is adequately protected in the event of a fire. These pumps are designed to provide a reliable and sufficient supply of water to fire suppression systems such as sprinklers, hydrants, and other fire protection equipment.",

      "The scope of this training shall include liquid supplies; suction, discharge, and auxiliary equipment; power supplies, including power supply arrangements; electric drive and control; diesel engine drive and control; steam turbine drive and control; and acceptance tests and operation.", 
      "Standards and regulations (NFPA 20,  NFPA 13,  NFPA 22,  NFPA 24,  NFPA 25,  NFPA 37,  NFPA 51B,  NFPA 70,  NFPA 70E,  NFPA 72,  NFPA 110, etc.)",

      "This course equips participants with solid understanding of the principles and practices for installing and maintaining stationary fire protection pumps, ensuring reliable and compliant systems that meet both safety standards and operational requirements."
